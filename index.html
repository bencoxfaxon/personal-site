        <p>
          I am a people-first leader and a teacher at heart. I have excellent
          writing and speaking skills. I make sure that I am role model and a
          mentor in whatever organization I am in and I do not take these duties
          lightly. I strive to constantly improve myself so I can be a better
          leader, teacher, and mentor, as all of these roles give me an enormous
          amount of fullfilment and purpose. I have served as Vice Wing
          Commander of Det 585 and school president and team captain at Yarmouth
          High School.
